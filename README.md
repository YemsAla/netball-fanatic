##### Typography

The typography used on the Netball Fanatix site focuses on readability and a modern, clean aesthetic.

The Maitree font is used for title headings and navigation with sans-serif as a fall-back option should the chosen font fail to function properly. 
Quicksand & Roboto are used as the main fonts for the body content with serif as the fallback font should fthe chosen fonts not load correctly to the website. 

- Font Sizes

The font sizes are appropriately varied to create a clear visual hierarchy. Larger sizes are used for headings and titles, making them stand out and guide the user's attention. Body text is set at a comfortable reading size.

- Font Weights
 A mix of font weights is used to differentiate between various text elements. Bold weights are used for headings and important information, while regular weights are used for body text.

Text alignment is primarily left-aligned, which is the most readable format for English text. Center alignment is used sparingly for elements such as titles and form labels to create emphasis.
