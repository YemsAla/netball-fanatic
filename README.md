### Design

##### Color Palette

![Color palette](assets/images/coolors-palette.png)
The website uses a palette of colours based around the bespoke logo image to maintain a standard identity across all pages. The colour palette was created using the Coolors website.

##### Typography

The typography used on the Netball Fanatix site focuses on readability and a modern, clean aesthetic.

The Maitree font is used for title headings and navigation with sans-serif as a fall-back option should the chosen font fail to function properly. 
Quicksand & Roboto are used as the main fonts for the body content with serif as the fallback font should fthe chosen fonts not load correctly to the website. 

- Font Sizes

The font sizes are appropriately varied to create a clear visual hierarchy. Larger sizes are used for headings and titles, making them stand out and guide the user's attention. Body text is set at a comfortable reading size.

- Font Weights
 A mix of font weights is used to differentiate between various text elements. Bold weights are used for headings and important information, while regular weights are used for body text.

- Text Alignment

Text alignment is primarily left-aligned, which is the most readable format for English text. Center alignment is used sparingly for elements such as titles and form labels to create emphasis.

- Line Spacing and Letter Spacing
Generous line spacing and appropriate letter spacing ensure that the text is not cramped, improving overall legibility.


##### Imagery

The imagery on the Netball Fanatix site is carefully selected to enhance the user experience and visually represent the sport of netball. Key features include:

- High-Quality Images
The site uses high-resolution images to create a professional and engaging visual appeal.

- Relevant Visuals
Images depict netball players, candid shots from games and a court outline, aligning with the site's theme and content.

- Placement
Images are strategically placed to complement the text, breaking up content and making the site more visually appealing.

Overall, the imagery is designed to effectively support the site's purpose, engaging visitors and enhancing the overall look.


### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for each page in wide and narrow views, using Balsamiq. These were used as a guide for development of the site layout and structure.

### Bug fixes

1. I had a lot of issues with my initial workspace being set up on Gitpod, which I was unable to resolve. I ended up swithcing to VS-Code Desktop as an IDE and started working locally so I could continue with my project development.
However, I was later able to create a new Gitpod workspace and link it with my project on VS-Code but that came with a new set of problems because I ended up working on 2 separate branches and some changes were not being pushed to the main.
I did a lot of work to merge the work in both branches and continue working in one space eventually.

2. On the 'About Netball' page, the bib positions column was overlapping the 'rules' column in mobile view. So I did some work to hide both columns in mobile view to ensure the layout of the page remained clean - see screenshot 

| Desktop       | Mobile           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ![About page desktop](assets/images/testing-images/about-page-desktop.png)     | ![About page mobile 1](assets/images/testing-images/about-page-mobile1.png) ![About page mobile 2](assets/images/testing-images/about-page-mobile2.png) |

3. On initial validation of my CSS code, I kept getting a parsing error for line 367, where I had an element nested inside another for the videos on the Playing Netball page and the validator didn't like that and therefore kept throwing up this error. 
To solve this issue, I removed, the *.col-3* element out of the *.tutorial-videos* element and although I was worried it might affect the output, it didn't. After doing this, I was able to pass the CSS code validation (see relevent screenshot in the *Code Validation* section above).
