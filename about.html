                        Netball is a fast-paced team sport that originated from basketball but with its own unique rules and gameplay. It's typically played by two teams of seven players each, aiming to score goals by shooting the ball through a hoop at each end of the court.

Netball has a fascinating history, dating back to the late 19th century when it was first played in England as an adapted version of basketball. Over time, netball evolved into its own distinct sport, with organized leagues and competitions established across the UK and Commonwealth countries.

The game is played on a rectangular court with designated areas for each player position. Players can't move with the ball and must pass it to teammates or shoot for goal within a certain time frame. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.

Netball is known for its emphasis on teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking. Each player has a specific role on the court, such as shooter, defender, or center, requiring them to work together to outmaneuver the opposing team.

Overall, netball is a thrilling and dynamic sport that combines elements of skill, strategy, and teamwork, making it a popular choice for players of all ages and abilities worldwide.
