                <p>People often ask “What on earth is netball?”</p>
                <p>And my answer is normally “It’s a bit like basketball but without the bouncing…or the running with the ball. But make no mistake, it can be just as intense!”</p>
                    <p>My name is Yemi, a Nigerian-born netball fanatic living in London. I have played netball for the best part of 25 years and in contrast to most other  things, I’d say I’ve improved with age.
                    Although netball is played in countries all around the world by women of all differing ages, and despite having its own event in the Commonwealth Games, it is still generally an unknown sport to the avergae person.
                    Netball Fanatix aims to shed some light on the great sport that is netball with all its benefits and teach you all you need to know about it.

                        <p>Netball is a fast-paced, dynamic team sport played by millions worldwide, with particular popularity in the UK and Commonwealth countries.</p>
                        <p> Originating from basketball, netball features seven players per team aiming to score goals by shooting the ball through a hoop.</p>
                            <p>In the UK, netball has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century, with organized leagues and competitions established across the country. It’s widely played in schools, clubs and communities, competitively & recreationally. 
                            The sport has seen significant growth in recent years, with initiatives aimed at making the sport more inclusive and accessible.
                            Netball's appeal lies in its blend of skill, strategy and teamwork. Players must demonstrate agility, accuracy
                             and tactical awareness to succeed on the court. The sport fosters camaraderie and sportsmanship, 
                             making it an enjoyable activity for players of all ages and abilities.
